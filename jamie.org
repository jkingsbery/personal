* [3/5] As an invited user, I want to upgrade my personal plan
** DONE Create subscriptions as part of user creation (both business and personal)

*** Seems like there should be none - we're doing things basically the same, just moving up when we create subscriptions
** DONE We should create the personal subscription when we create the user, but NOT the line
** TODO Try to remove duplication (if necessary) from `process_cancel_line` and `process_change_subscription`
** TODO If FinisherWorker fails, the user still doesn't have subscription objects yet to change

** DONE Onboarding needs to reload person's data on last step so we don't loop
** DONE Onboading process should kick you back to the number page if you already have a personal number
** TODO The bottom menu should use ng-show and a scope variable, not be shown/hidden like I'm doing now (easy for it to get messed up)
** DONE While in approved state, should show the plans page. After that show onboarding
** DONE Percentages are off by 2 orders of magnitude
** DONE Percentages need to be fixed (many are 1/Count, jumps straight from 50% to 100%)
** DONE Bug: not showing personal number 
** DONE error on submitting job.
